\large \underline{\textbf{About This Test:}}

\begin{itemize}
\item

  COVID-19 is a \textbf{disease} that is caused by a \textbf{virus} called
  SARS-CoV-2. This research test looks for the virus in the sample that was
  collected from your nose to decide if you have COVID-19. The technical term
  for this kind of test is “reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction,” or
  “RT-PCR” for short.

\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\large \underline{\textbf{Important Reminders}}

Before looking at your research test result, you should review the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item

  The \textbf{type of sample} that you collected and \textbf{the testing in the
  lab} are part of a \textbf{research study} and this report describes your
  \textbf{research test result.}

\item

  You collected this sample and labeled it by yourself (or for someone else) and
  returned it to the lab via a delivery service. It was not collected, labeled,
  or transported by a licensed healthcare professional like a nurse or doctor.
  This may impact your test result, and a healthcare provider may want to test
  you again.

\item

  Being part of this \textbf{research study} does not take the place of your
  normal medical care. If you are feeling very sick or are concerned about your
  test result, you should contact a doctor or healthcare provider.

\end{itemize}

\large \underline{\textbf{Understanding Your Result}}

This list gives all of the results that your test may show and describes what
each of these results means. You can print out or email this \textbf{research
test result} to share with your doctor or healthcare provider

Regardless of your test result, you should stay home and avoid being around
other people if you are feeling sick. \textbf{If your symptoms continue, you are
very sick or worried about your illness, or have questions about your research
test result, you should contact a doctor or healthcare provider.}

\begin{itemize}


\item

  \textbf{If your test says ``Not Detected (Negative)''}, it means our lab did not find the
  virus that causes COVID-19 in the sample that you sent to us. No test is
  perfect, and there is a small chance that you could have the virus even though
  your test is negative.

\item

  \textbf{If your test says ``Detected (Positive)''}, it means our
  lab found the virus that causes COVID-19 in the sample that you sent us. You
  should stay home and avoid being around other people, especially if you are
  feeling sick.

  Your result will be shared with the Washington State and local health
  departments. You do \textbf{not} need to report these results yourself. The
  health department may call you to ask questions about your illness and people
  you may have been around while you were sick.

\item

  \textbf{If your test says ``Inconclusive''}, it means our lab is not certain
  of your test result. No test is perfect, and an inconclusive result happens
  when we find a small amount of SARS-CoV-2 in your sample, but not enough for
  us to say that you have COVID-19.

\item

  \textbf{If your test says ``Unable to be tested''}, it means there was either
  not enough material on your sample for us to test, or there was an error when
  we ran the test. Since we are not able to test your sample, we could not find
  whether or not you have the virus that causes COVID-19.
